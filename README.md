# LocalHomes4Sale

LocalHomes4Sale is a web application for users to checkout local properties that are available for sale. This web application allows a user to create an account and post one or more properties for sale. It also provides complete description of the property that a user selects. If user wants to add more photos to show different views of the property, he can do that as well.

##### Instructions for USER:

- `Sign up` to create your user account and once you are logged in, you can go ahead and post your property with all the details up for sale.
- If you are using this web application to checkout properties for sale, you can do that once you sign up and are logged in using your email and password.
- You can always update your account details by clicking on the `Edit account` and then saving the changes by clicking on `Save changes`.
- If you ever want to delete your account you can do that by clicking `Delete account` and confirming with `yes` when requested.
- To post your a property up for sale, click on `Add new listing` and fill out all the required details. Don't forget to `Save` the post to make it visible in the list of properties available for sale.
- You can also edit listing for your property by selecting `Edit` for the one you want to make changes to. Again, make sure to `Save` the changes to update the details for your posting.
- To add more photos click on `Add photos` and it will take you to the photo upload page where you can upload photo with a caption describing the photo.


### Unsolved problems:
- No unsolved problems but could list some future features for this web application.
- I would like to add a list of favourite folders to add properties to each folder so that user can go back and check out those properties again easily.
- I also want to add some sort of search query on the listings page so users can search more specifically for what they are looking for. 

### Thankful for all the help and assistance that I got from Philippe, Jimmy, TAs & classmates.
